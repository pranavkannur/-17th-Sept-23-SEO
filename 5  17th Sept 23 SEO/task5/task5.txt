A favicon is a small icon associated with a particular website, typically displayed in the address bar of a browser
accessing the site or next to the site name in a userâ€™s list of bookmarks1. It is also known as a shortcut icon,
website icon, tab icon, URL icon, or bookmark icon.
Here is an example of how to add a favicon to an HTML document:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>My Website</title>
            <link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
        </head>
        <body>
            <!-- Page content goes here -->
        </body>
    </html>

In this example, the link element with rel="icon" specifies the location of the favicon file (favicon.ico) relative to
the HTML document. The type attribute specifies the MIME type of the file (image/x-icon).

By adding a favicon to your website, you can help improve its branding and recognition, as well as provide a more 
professional and polished appearance to your users
