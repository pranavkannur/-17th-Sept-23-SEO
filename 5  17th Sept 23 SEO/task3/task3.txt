The benefits of using meta tags are:
1]They can help improve the visibility and ranking of a web page on search engine results pages (SERPs) by providing relevant information to search engines, 
  such as the page title, description, and keywords.
2]They can help enhance the appearance and engagement of a web page when shared on social media platforms by using the Open Graph Protocol tags, which allow 
  developers to control how the page is displayed, such as the image, title, and description.
3]They can help ensure the correctness and accessibility of a web page by specifying the character encoding, language, and viewport settings, which can 
  affect how the browser interprets and displays the text and layout of the page.
4]They can help enable some HTTP header functionalities, such as refreshing or redirecting the page after a certain time, by using the http-equiv attribute.
